\item{lowmem}{(true/false) Whether a memory efficient algorithm should be used, default=false.}

\item{window}{(positive integer) The number of markers to include in each sliding window, default=50000.}

\item{overlap}{(positive integer) The number of markers of overlap between sliding windows, default=3000.}

\item{cluster}{(non-negative number) The maximum cM distance between individual markers that are
combined into an aggregate marker when imputing ungenotyped markers, default=0.005.}

\item{ne}{(integer) The effective population size when imputing ungenotyped markers, default=1000000.}

\description{
This function imputes genotypes of individuals at a STR \code{marker} locus from its
surrounding SNPs \code{snp.f} using a reference panel \code{ref.f} and a genetic map \code{map.f}.
}
\details{
This function imputes genotypes of individuals at a STR \code{marker} locus from its
surrounding SNPs \code{snp.f} using a reference panel \code{ref.f} and a genetic map \code{map.f}.
\emph{The reference panel must be phased and have no missing values.}
The imputed and phased SNP-STR vcf file is stored at \code{(base.dir)/imputed_str} where
the \code{base.dir} was set by running \code{\link{setup}} in the beginning of the pipeline.
From the imputed SNP-STR vcf, the function extracts imputed genotypes and genotype probabilities
at the STR \code{marker} locus and save it in the \code{(base.dir)/imputed_str} folder.
The output file name containing imputed genotypes probabilities is \verb{imp_str_(marker).GP.FORMAT}.
